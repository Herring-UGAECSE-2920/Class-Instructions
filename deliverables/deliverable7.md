# Deliverable 7

In Deliverable 7, you'll continue working on your Etch-A-Sketch mode with the aim of having it completed, meaning it achieves all of the requested functionality outlined in the [README](../README.md) and [Deliverable 6](deliverable6.md) adequately. You'll also begin your power supply design, another electrical engineering element to this project. Details for both below.

## Finish Designing, Building, Testing, and Documenting Etch-A-Sketch Mode (D)

This week you should be close to finishing your Etch-A-Sketch mode. It's important to remember that these milestones are not strict deadlines, however you should have at least some functionality working for the Etch-A-Sketch mode, and you should not move on to the rest of the project until you've completed the Etch-A-Sketch mode. 

**D**: As part of this deliverable we ask you to bring your plotter into class to demostrate the work you've done so far. This is so we can get a feel for how well the functionality has been implemented.

**D**: In addition to the in-class demo, you'll also need to submit a video of the work you've completed for your Etch-A-Sketch mode. It should be short and to the point, while showing each of the pieces of functionality that you've completed. This is primarily a fallback option for us to grade, in case hardware issues arise in class.
