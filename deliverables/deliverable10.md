# Deliverable 10

In deliverable 10, you'll continue to work on your Math Mode, with the aim of having it completed, meaning it achieves all of the required functionality outlined in the [README](../README.md) and [Deliverable 8](deliverable8.md) adequately. In additon to having the functionality implemented, you'll also need to have your plotter program launching on startup, as described below.

## Finish Designing, Building, Testing, and Documenting Math Mode and Demonstrate Launch on Startup (D)

This week you should be close to finishing your Math Mode. It's important to remember that these milestones are not strict deadlines, however you should have at least some functionality working for the Math Mode, and you should not move on to the rest of the project until you've completed the Math Mode. 

**D**: As part of this deliverable we ask you to bring your plotter into class to demonstrate the work you've done so far. This is so we can get a feel for how well the functionality has been implemented. As mentioned in the Project Specifications section of the readme, you should have your code [launch on startup](setup/launch-on-startup.md) (when you power on the Pi) to reduce the setup time/equipment needed for your demo. This is required functionality for your demonstration.  Your plotter should now be controlled only by the LCD/UI at this point.

**D**: In addition to the in-class demo, you'll also need to submit a video of the work you've completed for your Math Mode. It should be short and to the point, while showing each of the pieces of functionality that you've completed. This is primarily a fallback option for us to grade, in case hardware issues arise in class. This video can be more than 30 seconds.  Try to keep it at 90 seconds or less. Make sure you given commentary during the video so we know what you are doing.  Follow the order below in your video.

Be prepared to show the following in your demonstration and and include it as part your video: 1) Launch on Startup (plug in the plotter and the program should come up) 2) Automatic and manual calibration, 3) navigate to origin and draw axes (6 cm from origin in each direction), 4) demonstrate entering the constants/coefficients (`m`, `b`, `a`, `c`, and `r`) 5) Show each of the given equations being drawn correctly and to scale (mm) 6) Show the plotter giving feedback when the given equation can't be plotted/isn't on the page 7) Show an edge case of the plotter partially plotting an equation (not completely on the page).  Refer to rubric on ELC for more details.

For the in class checkpoint, we will go through each of the 7 "video" steps.

> Note: This deliverable grade is NOT the grade for Math Mode. It is simply a checkpoint grade to encourage you and your team to stay on track for this project. It will be a factor of your final grade, but your "minimum to be considered for" is evaluated at the END of the semester, based on the modes your team was able to implement. With that in mind, if you have not completed Math Mode to this point, showcase the work you have done, and aim to complete it as soon as possible so you can move on to GCode Mode.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Submit your **D** deliverable (Math Mode demo video) to the Design Deliverables 10 assignment folder on ELC. You do not need to submit code on ELC, just make sure your GitHub repository is up to date and contains the needed scripts.

2. Prepare for your in-person demonstration.

3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.

4. Submit your Weekly Project Management Report to the Deliverable 8 assignment folder on ELC.
