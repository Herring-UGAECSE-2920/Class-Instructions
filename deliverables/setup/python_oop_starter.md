# Python and Object-Oriented Programming Primer

Through this guide you all will be introduced to Python and Object-Oriented Programming principles for use in your project this semester. We'll link to a few different resources to teach fundamental concepts and syntax, as well as provide you with some simple exercises to keep you on track.

## Introduction to Python

Before we begin, if you haven't already, [follow this guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python on your computer. make sure you're able to launch Python either through the command line (CMD, Powershell, bash, etc.) or with an IDE or Editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VS Code with the Python Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

Next, work your way through the first 8 chapters of [Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com/), a fantastic resource for beginners to the language and programming in general. While completing the exercises is not a requirement, it is strongly recommended to cement what you're learning. 

If you have previous programming experience (CSEE Majors), feel free to skim through this to pick up on the differences between whatever language you're familiar with and Python. For a more specific guide, and since CSEE majors should have a good amount of experience with Java, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLovcfIugy8) on learning Python from your knowledge of Java.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Object-Oriented Programming refers to the practice of treating collections of data in a program as if it is an object. This object has publicly and privately accessible data, functions which can perform operations on this data (or on given data in the case of a [static function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(keyword))). As you might imagine, this abstraction can be very useful when creating large pieces of software which needs to be modular, adaptable, and easy to develop. Essentially, Object-Oriented Programming makes organizing data and code in a program much easier, improves the readability and adaptability of code, and generally makes working on large software projects more manageable.

To learn more about Object-Oriented Programming, read through [chapter 15](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-15.html) and [chapter 16](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-16.html) in the book mentioned previously.
