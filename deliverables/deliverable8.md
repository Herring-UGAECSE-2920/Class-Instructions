# Deliverable 8

Through deliverables 8, 9, and 10 you'll be designing the 'Equation Drawer' or 'Math Mode' outlined in the [README](../README.md) of this repository. In addition to beginning your Equation Drawer design, you'll need to demonstrate a calibration sequence for your plotter (a crucial component for drawing accurately). You should also continue working on your Power Supply, as we will be checking your progress on that as part of this deliverable.
