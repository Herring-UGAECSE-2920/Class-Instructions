# Deliverable 1

For this first deliverable y'all will be doing three things: completing your CATME form, setting up a Github account and submitting your username, and doing a "Hello World" exercise with Python/Github once you've been assigned a group.

## CATME Submission

Please fill out and submit the CATME form sent to your email! Do this by Wednesday 1/13/2021, otherwise we will assign you to a group at our discretion!

## Github Account Setup

Before we assign you to a group on the class Github organization, we'll need you to create a Github account (free) and submit your username or github email so that we can invite you. If you already have an account you don't need to make a new one, just submit it to the ELC assignment. Otherwise, Github account setup is fairly straight forward, simply go to [Github](https://github.com/login) and follow the instructions there! 

Once you've done that, go to ELC and submit your username/email in text to the 'Github Username Submission' assignment.

Do this as soon as you can, so that you can start on the next section!

## Github Exercise

After you've been assigned to a group, make sure you have set up your Github account and submitted your username to the assignment on ELC. Once you've done that, we will have an organization group invite sent to you as soon as groups are assigned from the CATME survey, likely Thursday afternoon (01/14/2021). To view and accept the organization group invite, go to the "Notifications" section on your Github home page. The icon should be in the upper right hand corner of the page, near your profile picture, and should look something like this:

Once you've accepted the group invite, you'll have access to your group's repository on the "Herring-UGAECSE-2920" Github organization. From here, you'll need to set up [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) and [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your personal computer to complete this assignment (assuming they are not already installed).

> Note: In order to clone Git repositories via SSH (recommended) you need to have the public SSH key for your computer linked to your Github account. Instructions for generating and linking SSH keys are in the Git setup guide linked above.

When you've got Git and Python set up, clone your group Git repository somewhere on your personal computer. From GitBash on Windows or a regular terminal on MacOS/Linux, run the following command, replacing [SSH Address] with the SSH address for your group's Git repository, found under the 'code' button on the repository home page, pictured below:

```
git clone [SSH Address]
```

When you have the repository cloned, create a Python script under a directory named `HelloWorldScripts` with the file name being `firstname_lastname.py` replacing `firstname` with your first name and `lastname` with your last name.

In the script, simply print your full name and exit. When done, make sure to save your changes and 'push' them to Github by following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) guide.

After that, you're finished.
