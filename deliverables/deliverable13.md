# Deliverable 13

In deliverable 13, you'll continue working on your GCode mode, with the aim of having it (along with the rest of your plotter) completed, meaning it achieves all of the required functionality outlined in the [README](../README.md) and [Deliverable 11](deliverable11.md). In addition to having the GCode mode ready for demonstration, you'll also need to have the rest of your plotter finalized and polished (other modes, UI/UX, wiring, cases, startup, etc.).

## Finish Designing, Building, Testing, and Documenting GCode Mode (D)

This week you should be close to finishing your GCode Mode. It's important to remember that these milestones are not strict deadlines, however you should have at least some functionality working for the GCode Mode, and you should not move on to focus on your documentation and report until you've completed the GCode Mode.

On your scheduled Demonstration day (Monday and Friday), we will release the additional `.gcode` files to be used during your demonstration. Make sure you get these files loaded onto the Pi, in the place you intend to parse them from, or you will not be able to demonstrate your GCode mode.

**D**: As part of this deliverable we ask you to bring your plotter into class to demonstrate the work you've done on GCode mode. This is so we can get a feel for how well the functionality has been implemented. As mentioned in the Project Specifications section of the readme, you should have your code [launch on startup](setup/launch-on-startup.md) (when you power on the Pi) to reduce the setup time/equipment needed for your demo. This is required functionality for your demonstration. If your Pi does not launch your program on startup, you will receive a `0` for this checkpoint.

**D**: In addition to the in-class demo, you'll also need to submit a video of the work you've completed for GCode mode. It should be short and to the point, while showing each of the pieces of functionality that you've completed. This is primarily a fallback option for us to grade, in case hardware issues arise in class. This video should be no more than 90 seconds. Make sure you given commentary during the video so we know what you are doing.  Follow the order below in your video.

Be prepared to show the following in your demonstration and and include it as part your video:

1. Launch on startup (Pi boots right into your program)
2. File selection for GCode mode
3. Demonstration of GCode mode with the supplied sample files (in the /deliverables/gcode-test-files/ directory) and the two new files released on your demo day.

For the in class checkpoint, we will go through each of the 3 "video" steps listed above.

> Note: This deliverable grade is the final opportunity to show GCode mode, and be "considered for" an A or above in this class. It is critically important that you and your team are ready to go for this demonstration, and that it is completed on time.

## Demonstrate your Completed Plotter (D)

When we complete the assessment for GCode mode, we'll move on to judging the rest of your plotter. This is the time to get any of your other operating modes checked off for completion (Etch-A-Sketch, Calibration, and Math Mode), but the primary goal of this demo is to judge the overall quality of work that you and your team have completed over the semester. This means testing the UI/UX as described in the UI section of the assessment document, being able to go into, test, and switch between modes, and generally being able to use the plotter as if it is an actual product. Some of the criteria will be judged subjectively based on how well we think things have been implemented, the look and feel of your plotter/hardware, and the general user experience.

**D**: After testing your GCode mode, we'll move on to testing your completed plotter. Again, your code should [launch on startup](setup/launch-on-startup.md) as a requirement. Then, we'll test your plotter UI/UX and other modes using the rough outline below:

1. Launch on Startup (Again)
2. UI/UX testing. Is the UI intuitive/responsive, does it follow the outline on the assessment document?
3. Navigation into/out of each of the operating modes.
4. Testing individual modes (this is where you will be checked off for Etch-A-Sketch, Calibration mode, and Math Mode if you had not been previously)
5. Evaluating overall quality, look, and feel of your plotter.

## Demonstration Schedule

For this set of deliverables, because of the time we estimate it will take to grade each of your plotters, we're splitting up the class into a Monday group and a Friday group. Groups demoing on Monday will be required to show their GCode mode working, but can come in during the week or on Friday to have their other modes checked off and have their fit/finish reevaluated. Groups demoing on Friday are required to have everything ready by then. 

You and your group will sign up in class before your demostration, when groups are decided for each day, we'll update the schedule below accordingly.

| Monday Groups | Friday Groups |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|               |               |
|               |               |
|               |               |
|               |               |
|               |               |
|               |               |
|               |               |

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Submit your **D** deliverable (Final Demonstration Video) to the Design Deliverables 13 assignment folder on ELC. You should also make sure your Github is up-to-date with the code running on your Pi, as we'll be looking at your code during the grading process (leave plenty of comments!).

4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation. This should be getting close to final, your User Manual is due on April 26th, and your Technical Manual/Report is due on April 30th.

5. Submit your Weekly Project Management Report to the Deliverable 13 assignment folder on ELC.
