# Deliverable 13



## Finish Designing, Building, Testing, and Documenting GCode Mode And Demostrate your Completed Plotter (D)

This week you should be close to finishing your GCode Mode. It's important to remember that these milestones are not strict deadlines, however you should have at least some functionality working for the GCode Mode, and you should not move on to focus on your documentation and report until you've completed the GCode Mode. The Demonstration will cover all aspects of your plotter, meaning we will be testing each mode again (too see improvement, completion, etc.) using the same testing criteria as listed in [Deliverable 7](./deliverable7.md) and [Deliverable 10](./deliverable10.md) and below.

**D**: As part of this deliverable we ask you to bring your plotter into class to demonstrate the work you've done this semester. This is so we can get a feel for how well the functionality has been implemented. As mentioned in the Project Specifications section of the readme, you should have your code [launch on startup](setup/launch-on-startup.md) (when you power on the Pi) to reduce the setup time/equipment needed for your demo. This is required functionality for your demonstration.

**D**: In addition to the in-class demo, you'll also need to submit a video of the work you've completed for your Plotter. It should be short and to the point, while showing each of the pieces of functionality that you've completed. This is primarily a fallback option for us to grade, in case hardware issues arise in class. This video can be more than 90 seconds. Try to keep it at 5 minutes or less. Make sure you given commentary during the video so we know what you are doing.  Follow the order below in your video.

In addition to your the previous demonstration requirements, be prepared to show the following in your demonstration and and include it as part your video: 1) Launch on startup (Pi boots right into your program) 2) Navigate to/from each of the different plotter modes using the encoders as specified in the UI/Assessments document 3) File selection for GCode mode 4) Demostration of GCode mode with the supplied sample files and one new file.

For the in class checkpoint, we will go through each of the 7 "video" steps from the previous deliverables and well as the 4 new ones listed above.

> Note: This deliverable grade is what we will use to determine your "minimum to be considered for" grade for this class. It will be based on the modes you and your team were able to complete during the semester, and how well those modes were implemented as well as the quality of your user manual and techincal documentation.
