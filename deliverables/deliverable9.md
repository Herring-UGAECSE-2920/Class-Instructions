# Deliverable 9

In deliverable 9, you'll continue working on your Math Mode for your plotter, with the intent to have most of the core functionality working by the end of the week. You'll also be finishing and submitting your power supply design this week, meaning you need to have your Eagle schematic/board layout, Multisim/breadboard simulation/testing, and Bill of Materials ready for submission by class on Friday. Details for both below.

## Continue Designing, Testing, and Documenting Your Design (P)

As noted above, you should continue making progress on Math Mode, and while no specific thing is required for this week, you should be making good progress on the Math Mode. As a goal for this week, have all of the given equations implemented and drawing correctly, and continue implementing some of the UI functions required for this mode (constants input, short/long press, equation selection/start, etc.). There is no "P" deliverable due for this item to turn in this week. You need to be looking forward to the accompanying design deliverable which is due Friday, March 19th.

## Finalize Your Power Supply (D)

A final Eagle schematic and fab-ready board layout, Multisim/other simulation, and Bill of Materials are due this week as a **D** design deliverable on Friday. Below is a reminder of the electrical specifications and design requirements for your power supply, as well as the requirements for submission.

### Design Specifications

- Your power supply will take in 120 VAC from the wall, and supply 12V 5A DC typical, with +25% peak output capability (should be able to output up to (12V\*5A) + (12V\*5A)\*0.25 = 60W + 15W = 75W Maximum Output) and +/- 5% allowable tolerance.

- less than or equal to 10% peak-to-peak ripple/noise on output (at full load)

- You must use [active components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component#Active_components) (i.e. not just transformers, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes, etc.)

- Your design should optimize for efficiency and cost

### Submission Requirements 

- You must submit a complete schematic and fabrication-ready board layout made with [Autodesk Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download).

- You must also submit a MultiSim simulation demonstrating the functionality, stability, and accuracy/quality of your design. Your simulation should measure the output characteristics of your design with and without a load, including measurements such as voltage, current, and [ripple/noise](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA03q000000YG05CAG&l=en-US). The submission for this item can be a quick video or a series of screenshots of your simulation schematic/measurements.

- In addition to your design and simulation, you'll also need to provide a [Bill of Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials) which should include DigiKey prices and part numbers for every electrical component.

**D**: Submit all of the items listed as screenshots/elements of **ONE** document. The Eagle Schematic/Board files should also be uploaded separately.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Submit your **D** deliverable (Final Power Supply Design) to the Design Deliverables 9 assignment folder on ELC. You do not need to submit code on ELC, just make sure your GitHub repository is up to date and contains the needed scripts.

4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.

5. Submit your Weekly Project Management Report to the Deliverable 9 assignment folder on ELC.
