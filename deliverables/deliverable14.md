# Deliverable 14

For Deliverable 14, you'll be turning in all of your plotter hardware, with a **Hard** deadline of Friday, April 23rd, 2021. No checkoffs for any of your plotter modes will be accepted past this point, and we will not, under any circumstance, provide an extension on your hardware turn in. In Dr. Herring's words, after Friday, the train will have left the station on getting items checked off and turning in your hardware. Since the main portion of the project is finished, you should turn your attention to finalizing your documentation for this course, including your User Technical Manuals, and your Final Presentation.

## Return All Hardware (P)

**P**: Turn in **Every** piece of hardware you received for this class, including those items which you damaged/replaced throughout the course of the project. This includes **every** component listed on the hardware checkoff list, and the boxes/containers we gave you to hold everything.

## Begin Finalizing User and Technical Manuals and Start your Final Presentation (P)

Now that your close to finishing up the build/development phase of this project, you and your team need to pivot to finalizing your User and Technical Manuals as outlined in the Assessment Document on ELC. We expect you guy to have a lot to say about the project, so it should be relatively easy to fill out that page requirement. Even though this is not a writing class, we expect technical writing of reasonable quality, good formatting/presentation, and we have an overall expectation of good, honest work being put into these documents.

You should also begin thinking about your final presentation. This presentation should be very similar

**P**: There is no 'P' deliverable item for this section, just make sure to start work on the User/Technical Manuals and your final presentation
