# Deliverable 14

For Deliverable 14, you'll be turning in all of your plotter hardware, with a **Hard** deadline of Friday, April 23rd, 2021. No checkoffs for any of your plotter modes will be accepted past this point, and we will not, under any circumstance, provide an extension on your hardware turn in. In Dr. Herring's words, after Friday, the train will have left the station on getting items checked off and turning in your hardware. Since the main portion of the project is finished, you should turn your attention to finalizing your documentation for this course, including your User Technical Manuals, and your Final Presentation.

## Return All Hardware (P)

**P**: Turn in **Every** piece of hardware you received for this class, including those items which you damaged/replaced throughout the course of the project. This includes **every** component listed on the hardware checkoff list, and the boxes/containers we gave you to hold everything.

> **WARNING**: **A grade of incomplete will be given until all items are returned in working condition.**

Please make sure the hardware is in working condition, as the TAs will be checking each major piece of hardware for proper functionality using the following testing suite:

1. Raspberry Pi
    - Inserting a known-good SD Card into the Raspberry Pi and making sure it boots and is accessable via SSH.
2. Adafruit Motor Hat
    - Using a known-good Raspberry Pi, we will put the hat onto the Pi, wire up the motors on our plotter, and use a test script (validated on known-good hardware) to validate that it is working correctly.
3. DFRobot LCD Hat
    - Using a known-good Raspberry Pi, we will put the hat onto the Pi, and test all of the functionality of the LCD hat using a test script (validated on known-good hardware).
4. X, Y, and Z Stepper Motors
    - Using a known-good Pi, Motor Hat, and H-Bridge configuration, we will test each of the stepper motors recieved to make sure they are not damaged. Please leave the steppers on your plotter, we'll use this to also make sure the plotter frame is not damaged.
5. 3A Buck/Boost Converter
    - We'll test to make sure your Buck/Boost Converter can supply 5V and 3A using a test load and current/voltage meters.

## Begin Finalizing User and Technical Manuals and Start your Final Presentation (P)

Now that your close to finishing up the build/development phase of this project, you and your team need to pivot to finalizing your User and Technical Manuals as outlined in the Assessment Document on ELC. We expect you guy to have a lot to say about the project, so it should be relatively easy to fill out that page requirement. Even though this is not a writing class, we expect technical writing of reasonable quality, good formatting/presentation, and we have an overall expectation of good, honest work being put into these documents.

You should also begin thinking about your final presentation. This presentation should be very similar to your in semester presentations in style with the following content requirements:

1. Final Product
    - Short descriptition of operation.
    - Short summary of your work over the semester.
2. Key Milestones
    - Etch-A-Sketch, Math Mode, GCode Mode.
    - Challenges faced/Sticking points for each mode.
    - How you and your team overcame the adversity.
3. Revisions/Ideas for Improvement
    - describe some revisions you can make to your plotter to improve it further.
    - ideas for how to accompish this.
4. Class Suggestions/Plotter Project Suggestions
    - What worked well about the class/structure and what didn't. What can we do to improve it.
    - What worked well about the plotter project, and how we can improve it.

**P**: There is no 'P' deliverable item for this section, just make sure to start work on the User/Technical Manuals and your final presentation

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Return all of your hardware, in working order, on Friday, April 23rd. There will **NOT** be any extension on this date, as we need time for grading your presentations/reports and time to make sure everything is in working order and organized.

2. Begin finalizing your user and Technical manuals and start your final presentation.

3. Submit your Weekly Project Management Report to the Deliverable 14 assignment folder on ELC. You shouldn't have much left to put on here about your work on the plotter, but you will stil have plenty to write about. Talk about your progress on the manuals, the presentation, and possibly include a reflection on the work you've done this semester.
