# Deliverable 12



## Continue Designing, Testing, and Documenting Your Design (P)

As noted above, you should continue making progress on Math Mode, and while no specific thing is required for this week, you should be making good progress on the GCode Mode. As a goal for this week, have all of the given GCode instructions implemented and performing correctly, start working on reading files and executing instructions sequentially, and continue implementing some of the UI functions required for this mode (File selection). There is no "P" deliverable due for this item to turn in this week. You need to be looking forward to the accompanying design deliverable which is due Friday, April 16th.
